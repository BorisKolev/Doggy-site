<h1>About Us</h1>	
<p>A dog is a slender, muscular mammal with four legs and a tail. Dogs are covered with fur that is usually a similar colour all over its body or speckled. They are well-built for hunting, with excellent senses to track prey, strong legs for running, and sharp teeth for biting. Smaller dogs, such as foxes, prey on rodents and birds. Bigger species, such as the grey wolf, work in large groups, called packs, to hunt mammals as big as deer. Dogs have short, blunt claws and hard pads on their feet.<strong> A dog can be identified by its nose print, which is as unique as a human fingerprint.</strong></p>

<p>A dog's nose is moist. Dogs have a very good sense of smell and can detect scents from great distances. Dogs use smell to communicate with each other, for example, they urinate to mark their territory.</p>
<p>Dogs have an excellent sense of hearing. Most dogs have large, pointed ears that help them to catch sound. They also use their ears to communicate with other dogs</p>
<p> Dogs have fur on their body that helps them to stay warm. </p>
<p> Dogs have powerful muscles in their hind (back) legs. These muscles make them strong runners.</p>
